Additionally AI can facilitate the development of disease-resistant crops  mitigating the impact of pests and diseases on agricultural productivity.

### Financial Inclusion: Empowering Economic Participation

AI can promote financial inclusion by providing access to financial services for underserved populations. AI-powered fintech applications can assess creditworthiness and provide  loans to individuals who may have been  previously  excluded from traditional banking systems. Additionally, AI can streamline remittances,  making it easier and more affordable for migrant workers to send money back to their families in developing countries.

## Managing the Risks:  Navigating the Ethical and  Practical Challenges

Despite  the immense potential of AI to transform developing countries, it  is  crucial to acknowledge the associated risks and challenges. Careful consideration must be given to  ethical concerns  such as privacy, bias and accountability, to ensure that  AI is used responsibly and equitably. Additionally practical challenges, such as a lack of infrastructure and skilled workforce, need to be addressed to create an enabling environment for AI adoption.
